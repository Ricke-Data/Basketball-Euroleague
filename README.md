# Basketball Euroleague

This project manages and analyzes data from the Basketball Euroleague over the last three seasons, with a focus on KK Crvena zvezda and KK Partizan and most of their results. It covers the entire data lifecycle, including:

- **Database Creation**: Designed and implemented using Oracle SQL Developer.
- **ETL Processes**: Extracted, transformed, and loaded data using Oracle Data Integrator (ODI).
- **Data Warehousing**: Developed and maintained a data warehouse to store and organize large volumes of data.
- **Data Visualization**: Created insightful visualizations and reports using Power BI.

## Features

- Comprehensive data management for three seasons of Basketball Euroleague.
- Efficient ETL processes for data integrity and accuracy.
- Organized and easily accessible data storage through data warehousing.
- Clear and actionable insights using Power BI visualizations.

## Technologies Used

- SQL and PL/SQL
- Oracle SQL Developer
- Oracle Data Integrator (ODI)
- Power BI

## Purpose

This project demonstrates my knowledge in data management, ETL processes, data warehousing, and data visualization. It was designed to showcase my basic skills, knowledge, and understanding of these areas.

## How to Use

1. ## Review the SQL scripts

- Check the SQL and PL/SQL scripts in the `sql/` and `pl-sql/` directory to see how the database was created and populated.

## Open the Power BI file

- Open the Power BI file in the `powerbi/` directory to explore the visualizations and reports.

## View ODI process examples

- Review the images of ODI processes in the `images/odi` directory to understand the ETL processes.

## View database examples

- Review the images of the database in the `images/euroleague` directory to see the structure and data.
